# Data-mining-using-NLP

In this project we are looking for a possible use of the new york times articles as training data for Natural Language Processing projects.

We wrote New York Times scraper which uses BeautifulSoup to scrape the article pages. `nytscraper.py` works with python 2.7 and the other one guess.

We also wrote an alternative scraper `nytsnippetgetter.py` that does not parse the actual html pages to get the information. The difference is that instead of full article body we get just the `snippet`, `lead_paragraph` and `asbtract`. The advantage is that we obtain data even about articles that are available for subcribers only. Additionally, it is quicker.
